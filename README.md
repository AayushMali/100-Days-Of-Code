100 Days of Code Challenge
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repo tracks my daily progress as I improve my Web Development and Python skills.

🚀 What is 100 Days of Code?
It’s a challenge to code for 1 hour every day for 100 days. Throughout this journey, I’ll be tackling coding problems, building projects, and diving deeper into web and Python development.

🎯 Goals:
Web Dev: Master advanced JS, React, Express, and full-stack development.
Python: Strengthen Python fundamentals, build backend apps, and work on data projects.
📝 Plan:
Days 1-10: Refactor and improve existing projects on GitHub.
Days 11-30: Dive into advanced topics (React hooks, Express.js, MongoDB).
Days 31-50: Build full-stack apps and explore Python frameworks (Flask/Django).
Days 51-70: Contribute to open-source and work on personal projects.
Days 71-100: Deep dive into new tools, build a final project, and deploy.
📈 Progress:
Each day, I'll document the task I worked on, what I learned, and my project updates.
Feel free to follow along and contribute to this coding adventure!
