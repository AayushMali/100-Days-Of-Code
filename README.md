# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey! This repository tracks my daily progress as I improve my **Web Development** and **Python** skills. I’ll be documenting my learning, projects, and challenges throughout the next 100 days.

## 🚀 What is 100 Days of Code?

The **100 Days of Code** challenge is a commitment to code for **1 hour every day for 100 consecutive days**. The goal is to build consistency and improve coding skills. I’ll be working on solving problems, building projects, and learning new concepts each day.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Web Development**: Master advanced JavaScript, React, Express, full-stack development.
- **Python**: Deepen understanding of Python, build backend apps, work on data manipulation and automation projects.

## 📝 Plan

- **Days 1-10**: Refactor existing GitHub projects. Focus on improving code quality and adding new features.
- **Days 11-30**: Explore advanced JavaScript topics (React hooks, state management) and strengthen backend knowledge (Express.js, MongoDB).
- **Days 31-50**: Build full-stack apps (React + Express) and learn Flask/Django for Python backend development.
- **Days 51-70**: Contribute to open-source projects and build personal projects.
- **Days 71-100**: Experiment with new technologies (e.g., Docker, GraphQL) and work on a final full-stack project.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Each day, I will:
- Complete a coding task or project.
- Share a brief summary of what I worked on.
- Push daily updates and challenges to this repository.
