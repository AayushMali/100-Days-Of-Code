# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repository contains the tasks, projects, and challenges I will be working on over the next 100 days to improve my coding skills.

## What is 100 Days of Code?

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a commitment to code for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days. It's a great way to build consistency and make significant progress in programming. Throughout this journey, I will be learning new concepts, building projects, solving problems, and documenting my progress.

## Goals

- Enhance my knowledge of various programming languages and technologies
- Solve coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode and Codewars
- Revise and deepen my understanding of JavaScript, React, Express, and other web development frameworks
- Build personal projects and contribute to open-source

## Progress Tracking

I will be logging my daily progress here. Each day I will:

1. Complete a coding task or project.
2. Share a brief summary of what I learned or worked on.

Stay tuned for daily updates on my progress, and feel free to join me in this coding adventure!
